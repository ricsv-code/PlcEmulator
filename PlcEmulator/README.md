#PlcEmulator(beta) v1.1

Actually a PlcSimulator. Semantics. Changing name is a hassle.

##How to use?

Connect to software meant to communicate with PLC using the TruckCam PLC_PC_EthernetProtocol.
Make sure IP and Port matches before connecting. Use the sent/received windows to analyze data transfers.


##ChangeLog

DarkMode implemented.
Model logic revised in preparation for next steps.
Script support implemented.


##Author Comments

My first WPF-project. I've learned a lot creating this. 
There are a myriad of inconsistencies and probably a lot of unused code.
